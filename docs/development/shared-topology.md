# Shared topology roots

Multigres clusters can share one physical etcd cluster while retaining
independent logical topology. Isolation comes from the root passed to the
topology client, not from provisioning a separate etcd cluster for every
Multigres cluster or cell.

## Canonical layout

When a topology root is omitted, the operator derives these paths:

```text
/multigres/<cluster-id>/global
/multigres/<cluster-id>/<cell-name>
```

The `multigres.com/project-ref` annotation is the preferred stable
`<cluster-id>`. Without that annotation, the operator uses two path segments,
`<namespace>/<MultigresCluster name>`, so clusters with the same name in
different namespaces cannot collide. Values that are not safe path segments
are percent-encoded.

With managed topology and `topoTLS` enabled, the cluster root is also the
client certificate's common name and must fit within 64 bytes. If the
namespace/name fallback exceeds that limit, it becomes
`/multigres-fallback/<hash>`, where `<hash>` is the unpadded base64url SHA-256
digest of the original escaped cluster root. Shorter roots, plaintext roots,
and external topology roots keep their existing paths. The `topoTLS` setting
is immutable, so this does not move running plaintext clusters to another
keyspace.

If an explicit global or cell root points outside the shortened identity, the
operator reports a certificate failure instead of changing it. Align the
configured root and migrate any existing topology data before retrying.

Explicit project refs are never shortened. With managed topology TLS, they
must fit within 53 bytes after percent-encoding. An oversized ref prevents
certificate creation and sets `TopologyReady=False` with reason
`TopoCertificateFailed`, including the root length and limit. The condition
clears after a successful topology connection.

For example, a cluster annotated with project ref `proj_123` and containing
cells `zone-a` and `zone-b` uses:

```text
/multigres/proj_123/global
/multigres/proj_123/zone-a
/multigres/proj_123/zone-b
```

If a cell does not configure a separate local topology server, its cell record
uses the global/shared etcd address with the cell-specific root. The address is
shared; the global and cell keyspaces are not.

Explicit non-empty roots are preserved for both managed and external topology
configuration. This permits specialized layouts and avoids silently moving an
existing cluster's data.

## Rollout and existing clusters

Older operator versions materialized `/multigres/global` in the
`MultigresCluster` spec. Because that value is explicit after admission, an
upgrade deliberately leaves it unchanged. Do not connect two such clusters to
the same etcd instance: they would still share one keyspace.

Before moving an existing cluster to shared etcd, choose one of these paths:

1. For disposable environments, remove/reset the old topology data and remove
   the materialized root so admission can assign the canonical root.
2. For environments whose topology data must survive, copy or migrate the old
   keyspace to the canonical root, update the configured root, and validate the
   cluster before retiring the old keyspace.

The operator does not automatically migrate etcd keys. Address changes and root
changes must be coordinated so components never read a partially migrated
topology.

## Physical etcd ownership

Canonical roots make shared etcd safe, but they do not by themselves change
who provisions the etcd StatefulSet. Cluster-wide shared-etcd lifecycle,
credentials, placement, and ownership are separate infrastructure/operator
work. Until that is deployed, the same root scheme also prevents collisions
when multiple clusters are pointed at an externally managed etcd service.
