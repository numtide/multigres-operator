// Package cell implements the controller for the Cell resource.
//
// The Cell controller manages the MultiGateway component, which serves as the
// entry point for client connections within a failure domain (cell). Its
// responsibilities include:
//
//   - MultiGateway Deployment: Creates and maintains a Deployment that runs the
//     MultiGateway proxy. This component routes client queries to the appropriate
//     shards based on the topology configuration.
//
//   - MultiGateway Service: Exposes the MultiGateway Deployment via a Kubernetes
//     Service, providing a stable endpoint for clients within the cell.
//
//   - Status Aggregation: Monitors the Deployment's availability and updates the
//     Cell's status conditions accordingly. Reports ready replica counts and
//     overall health phase.
//
// The Cell controller is part of the resource-handler module and operates at the
// "leaf" level of the resource hierarchy, directly managing Kubernetes-native
// resources (Deployments and Services) rather than other Custom Resources.
