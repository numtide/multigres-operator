// Package shard implements the controller for the Shard resource.
//
// The Shard controller is the most complex controller in the operator, responsible
// for managing all infrastructure required to run a database shard. It creates and
// maintains the following components:
//
// # PostgreSQL Pools
//
// For each pool defined in the Shard spec, the controller creates:
//   - StatefulSet: Runs PostgreSQL replicas with proper volume claims and configuration.
//   - Headless Service: Enables direct pod addressing for replication.
//   - Backup PVC: Shared persistent volume for backup storage (when configured).
//
// Pools can span multiple cells for high availability. In multi-cell configurations,
// the controller creates separate StatefulSets per cell while maintaining a unified
// view in the Shard status.
//
// # MultiOrch Orchestrator
//
// The controller manages the MultiOrch component which handles:
//   - Leader election and failover for PostgreSQL
//   - Replication topology management
//   - Health monitoring and automatic recovery
//
// For each cell where the shard operates, a MultiOrch Deployment and Service are created.
//
// # Configuration Management
//
// The controller creates ConfigMaps for PostgreSQL configuration:
//   - pg_hba.conf template: Authentication rules for client connections.
//
// # Status Aggregation
//
// The controller continuously monitors all managed resources and aggregates their
// status into the Shard's status fields, including:
//   - Ready/Total pod counts across all pools
//   - List of cells where the shard is deployed
//   - Orchestrator readiness per cell
//   - Overall phase (Initializing, Progressing, Healthy)
