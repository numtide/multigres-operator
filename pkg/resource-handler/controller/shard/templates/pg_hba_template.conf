# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# Generated by Multigres - Helping you Scale PostgreSQL
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access. Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             {{.User}}       trust
local   all             all             peer

# Replication connections - trust from all IPs for testing
# PRODUCTION: Replace 'trust' with 'scram-sha-256' and configure passwords
local   replication     all                                     trust
host    replication     all             0.0.0.0/0               trust
host    replication     all             ::0/0                   trust

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all     all             0.0.0.0/0                       trust
host    all     all             ::0/0                           trust

# IPv4 external connections
host    all     all             0.0.0.0/0                       trust
host    all     all             ::0/0                           trust

# IPv6 external connections
host    all     all             ::0/0                           trust
