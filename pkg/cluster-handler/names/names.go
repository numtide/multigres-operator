// Package names generates deterministic, unique names for Kubernetes objects.
//
// Strategy:
//  1. For dynamic, user-defined, or nested resources (e.g., Cells, TableGroups, Shards),
//     we use JoinWithConstraints to append a safety hash. This prevents collisions when
//     strings are truncated to fit Kubernetes length limits (e.g., 63 chars for labels).
//  2. For singleton or static resources (e.g., GlobalTopo, MultiAdmin) that are 1:1 with
//     the cluster and have predictable short names, we use simple string concatenation
//     without hashing for better readability and predictability.

// If the function is called again with the same parts, in the same order,
// the hash will also be the same. This determinism allows you to use the resulting
// name to ensure idempotency when creating objects.
//
// However, the hash will differ if the parts are rearranged, or if substrings
// within parts are moved to adjacent parts. The resulting generated name,
// while deterministic, is thus guaranteed to be unique for a given list of parts,
// even if the parts themselves are allowed to contain the separator.

// (e.g. Pod, Service) whose name is being generated, to ensure the name is
// accepted by Kubernetes validation. Most objects in Kubernetes accept any name
// that conforms to the DefaultConstraints, with the notable exception of Service
